## Notes

**Status:** 🔨 Stub Module (Planned for Implementation)

This module is currently a stub (placeholder) with example functions. It is planned for future implementation.

### Planned Implementation

This module is intended to house functions converted from the following scripts (as categorized in [`topic_map.md`](../../../topic_map.md)):

- `open_vsc_with_wsl.bat` - Opens VSCode with WSL remote connection - development environment tool

These scripts are located in:
- `command_prompt/` - Original working scripts
- `snippets/command_prompt/` - Preserved copies

When implemented, this module will provide reusable Command Prompt utilities for development environment tools including VSCode and WSL integration.
