# FileUtilities (PowerShell)

**Status:** 🔨 Stub Module (Planned for Implementation)

## Planned Implementation

This module is intended to house functions converted from the following scripts (as categorized in [`topic_map.md`](../../../topic_map.md)):

- `Display-DirectoryTree.ps1` - Displays directory structure in tree format - file system utility
- `Create-IndexShortcuts.ps1` - Creates shortcuts for file navigation and organization

These scripts are located in:
- `powershell/` - Original working scripts
- `snippets/powershell/` - Preserved copies

```
