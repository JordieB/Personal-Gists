**Status:** 🔨 Stub Module (Planned for Implementation)

This module is currently a stub (placeholder) with example functions. It is planned for future implementation.

### Planned Implementation

This module is intended to house functions converted from the following scripts (as categorized in [`topic_map.md`](../../../topic_map.md)):

- `macos_maintenance.sh` - Comprehensive automated maintenance script for macOS systems

These scripts are located in:
- `zsh/` - Original working scripts
- `snippets/zsh/` - Preserved copies

When implemented, this module will provide reusable zsh functions for automated system maintenance routines for macOS systems.
