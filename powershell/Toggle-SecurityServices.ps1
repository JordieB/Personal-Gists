.SYNOPSIS
    SECURITY NOTICE: This script is intentionally commented out for safety.
    Toggles Malwarebytes and Windows Defender services on or off.

.DESCRIPTION
    WARNING: This script is commented out by design for security purposes.
    
    The Toggle-SecurityServices function enables or disables Malwarebytes and Windows Defender services 
    based on user input. It's designed to quickly switch security services for scenarios like software 
    installation where these services might interfere.
    
    IMPORTANT: Disabling security services exposes your system to threats. Only use this script if you 
    fully understand the security implications and have alternative protection measures in place.

.PARAMETER Action
    A string parameter that accepts either 'On' or 'Off' to toggle the services accordingly.

.EXAMPLE
    # To enable this script, uncomment the function and use:
    # Toggle-SecurityServices -Action 'Off'
    # Disables Malwarebytes and Windows Defender.

.EXAMPLE
    # Toggle-SecurityServices -Action 'On'
    # Enables Malwarebytes and Windows Defender.
